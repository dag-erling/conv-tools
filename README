		      Encoding conversion tools
		      -------------------------

The mixconv utility reads a mixed-encoding text file, analyzes each
line to determine whether it is in 7-bit ASCII, an 8-bit encoding,
UTF-8 or WTF-8, converts everything to UTF-8 and prints the result to
standard output.

The dirconv utility scans a directory structure, analyzes each file
and directory name to determine whether it is in 7-bit ASCII, an 8-bit
encoding, UTF-8 or WTF-8, converts everything to UTF-8, and renames
the files and directories accordingly.

The conv-tools utilities were originally written for for one-off use
at the University of Oslo and subsequently released under the 3-clause
BSD license.
