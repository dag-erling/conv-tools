.Sh NAME
.Nm mixconv
.Nd transcode mixed-encoding files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dv
.Op Fl f Ar charset
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads text encoded in a mixture of UTF-8 and a non-UTF 8-bit
encoding and converts it to UTF-8.
.Pp
The non-UTF 8-bit encoding is assumed to be Latin-1, unless a
different encoding is specified with the
.Fl f
option.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\" .It Fl 7
.\" Print lines which are pure 7-bit ASCII.
.\" .It Fl 8
.\" Print lines which contain non-ASCII characters but are not valid
.\" UTF-8.
.It Fl d
Show debugging information.
This option can be specified multiple times to increase the level of
detail.
.It Fl f Ar charset
Specify the assumed character set for non-ASCII, non-UTF-8 text.
The default is
.Dq iso8859-1 .
.It Fl h
Print a usage message and exit.
.\" .It Fl u
.\" Print lines which contain non-ASCII characters and are valid UTF-8
.\" but not WTF-8.
.It Fl v
Print the source reversion number and exit.
.\" .It Fl w
.\" Print lines which seem to be WTF-8-encoded.

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility and this manual page were written by
.An Dag-Erling Sm\(/orgrav Aq des@des.no
for the University of Oslo.
.\" .Sh NOTES
.\" The
.\" .Nm
.\" utility works by attempting to decode each name as if it were a
.\" sequence of UTF-8 characters.
.\" It is possible, but highly unlikely, that a random string of
.\" characters in a non-UTF single-byte encoding would look like a valid
.\" UTF-8 sequence.
.\" .Pp
.\" Reliable detection of WTF-8 is only possible if the original 8-bit
.\" encoding is known.
.\" .Pp
.\" The exclusion filter is applied
.\" .Em before
.\" name conversion.
.\" Character classes are unlikely to work as expected on unconverted
.\" names.
